<!-- 
    Here use a Bootstrap element called a jumbotron, a large box that stands out from the rest of the page. 
    Typically, itâ€™s used on home pages to hold a brief description of the overall project and a call to action
    that invites the viewer to get involved.
    - A jumbotron is implemented as a pair of div elements with a set of styling directives applied to them
    - The outer div has padding and margin settings, a light background color, and rounded corners.
    - The inner div is a container that changes along with the window size and has some padding as well
    - The py-4 selector adds padding to the top and bottom of the div element.
    - Inside the jumbotron are three elements.
        - The first is a short message, Track your learning, that gives new visitors a sense of what Learning Log does
        - The <h1> element is a first-level header, and the display-3 selector adds a thinner and taller look 
        to this particular header.
        - We also include a longer message that provides more information about what the user can do with their
        learning log. This is formatted as a lead paragraph, which is meant to stand out from regular paragraphs
    - Rather than just using a text link, we create a button that invites users to register an account on Learning Log 
        - This is the same link as in the header, but the button stands out on the page and shows the viewer 
        what they need to do in order to start using the project.
